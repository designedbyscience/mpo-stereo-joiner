Take MPO files and create side by side JPEGs


I have this little Fuji camera (which is an amazing photography toy) which stores images as MPO files - a format most software can't understand. The MPO file really just contains 2 JPEGs, so this script (with the help of exiftool and Image Magick) takes those JPEGs and puts them side by side.

This works well with [VR Embed](http://vrembed.org/create/)
